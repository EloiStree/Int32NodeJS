# Int32NodeJS
Node JS local website in for Int32 and Integer Games.

Found here my local int32 local website that facilitate some interaction in Unity3D Integer Games by having some ether code like verification on the website and not in the game.
It should be on a server but I don't have the income and can't risk troll to DDOS me.

If you need those service in your game.
Feel free to copy this code under the beerware license :)-
